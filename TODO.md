# FEATURES V1

## ECS

[X] Make serialized able to be extended in modules (put it into introspect, make intropect better ...)
[X] Make the archetype able to store datas in plain array for performances
[X] Put a get_constructor function into introspect
[X] Implements entity deletion
[X] Resources and services containers should be merged
[X] Abstract resources
[X] Split abstractions and implementations for all crates
[X] Make native systems easy to use
[X] Move ECS structure to a struct of array instead an array of struct (more efficient, easier to implement)
[X] Implement ECS hierarchy
[X] Remove the "Entity" component to replace it by a more cache friendly solution
[ ] Add an exception when you try to access a deleted entity, propagate it into js
[ ] There should be some memory leak in archetype
[ ] Test and stabilize ECS
[ ] Find a way to move the introspect declaration into the associated traits

## Editor

[X] Base editor
[X] Implement a basic hook system
[X] Create a pseudo DOM to abstract the interface creation
[X] Wrap the DOM system with iced
[ ] Expose the GUI API to javascript to create custom component editor
[X] Components visualization
[X] Entity hierarchy visualisation
[X] Resources browser
[ ] Resources visualisation, take the material as an example and try to make it easy to edit in sprite component
[X] Sprite gizmos
[X] Run/Pause
[X] Save/Load
[ ] Fix resize gizmos
[ ] Select an object when clicking on it (set_scissor_rect)
[ ] Add componnent from editor
[ ] Remove component from editor

## Graphics

[X] Material should store wgpu bind groups
[X] Supports Meshes
[X] Material fields should now be a string identifier
[X] Sprite vertex/indices should be shared accross all sprites
[X] Squad transform should be done in shader instead of CPU
[X] Proceed instantied rendering
[X] Make instances parametrizable in material/shader
[ ] Sprites should simply edit a field of material
[ ] Implement rendering composers

## Physics

[X] Primitive physics collider components (shared accross every physics engine)
[ ] Mesh physics collider components (shared accross every physics engine)
[ ] Implements basic Rapier crate features
[ ] Implements a collision only physic engine

## Game tools

[X] Inputs
[X] Time service
[ ] Animations everywhere (including sprite animations)
[ ] State manager
[ ] Tiles editor (make something like RPG maker, as easy to use as possible)
[ ] Particles

### Nice to have

[ ] SplineBrush (something like spriteshape for lines but more easy to use, width should be modifiable, thought to be used with a graphic tablet)
[ ] ShapeBrush (something like spriteshape but more easy to use, thought to be used with a graphic tablet)
[ ] 2D skeletons (take inspiration with unity's one wich is realy nice)
[ ] Implements a complete physic engine
[ ] 2D lights

## Scripting

[ ] Find a better way to store SerializedComponent, to have something more effective on read
[Â ] Allow to handle size variations of SerializedComponent
[ ] There should be some memory leak when a js object is released
[X] Javascript module is highly unsafe cause i force to put a one thread runtime into a multi thread host
[ ] Implement web workers in js
[X] Allow javascript to play with signals (depends on next)
[X] Fix javascript services
[ ] Make javascript able to import modules via package.json
[ ] Test and make microjob library compatible with javascript
[X] Abstract everything (espescialy javascript and render)
[ ] Typescript
[ ] Expose rust-like enums in serialized
[ ] Create a macro to expose the enums easely to serialized

## Others

[ ] Implement a basic sound features
[X] Dynamic libraries rust
[X] Hot reload js
[ ] Hot reload rust
[X] Implements a profiling tool

# Code clean

[ ] Put an auto-analyser and clean the code
[ ] Tests everywhere
[ ] Rust doc everywhere
[ ] Remove as many unwrap as possible (ecs and javascript)
[ ] A lot of unsafe code were created to avoid lifetime issue in ecs, remove as many as possible
[ ] Use a tool that detect unused dependencies
