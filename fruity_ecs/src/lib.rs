//! ECS
//!
//! Provide an ECS, this ECS has hierarchy between all the entities and is intended to be easely extended by a scripting engine
//!
//! The ECS is organized with the following structure
//! - Services are object that can provide function, intended to be used by the systems, for example a log service can provide functionalities to log things, everything is a service including the entity storage and the system storage
//! - Systems are function that do the logic part of the application, they can compute components and use services
//! - Entities represent any object stored in the ecs, entities are composed of components, in a game engine, a game object for example
//! - Components are structure where the datas are stored
